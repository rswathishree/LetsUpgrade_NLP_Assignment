# LetsUpgrage_NLP_AssignmentT=
I am Swathi R, a budding engineer from Easwari Engineering College.
I am new to this NLP world.
I came to know about free sessions provided by Letsupgrade and I used the same to explore Natural Language Processing.
Sessions were taken by Gopal Sir, Which gave me the brief about NLP and idea on NLP projects.
I did this assignment from the basic knowledge gained from the sessions about NLP.
